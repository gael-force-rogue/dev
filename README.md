This is my main development repository.

### Folders
- `src` is the main Vex V5 project
- `vexcom` is a binary that the VexCode Extension seems to use to upload binaries to the brain. I'll explore it more once I figure out how to build the project from the command line.
- `old` archived code

### VPP
This is a little wrapper library around VEXCode to improve the API. I don't suggest using it for now but if you do please credit me.
